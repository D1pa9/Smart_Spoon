# Smart Spoon: Enhancing Taste Perception Using Electric Stimulation

Smart Spoon is an AI-powered research project aimed at enhancing taste perception through electric stimulation. This software-focused solution integrates computer vision, data analytics, and NLP to explore how technology can improve food experiences and assist users with dietary limitations or taste impairments.

##  Project Overview

The system is composed of three major components:

1. **Food Recognition**  
   Uses computer vision to identify food items and categorize them based on type and taste profile.

2. **Market Analysis**  
   Gathers and analyzes survey data to study consumer preferences, dietary habits, and taste trends using data science techniques.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Applies natural language processing (NLP) to social media comments, reviews, and survey responses to gauge public sentiment toward food experiences and electric stimulation technologies.

#Features

- Real-time food recognition using image processing
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- Survey and market data visualization
- Sentiment analysis on food-related text data
- Modular structure for research and experimentation

#Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/D1pa9/Smart_Spoon.git
cd Smart_Spoon
```

### 2. Set up your environment

Use Python 3.8+ and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV, TensorFlow
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- NLTK, TextBlob
- Streamlit

##  Use Cases

- Research in sensory enhancement and assistive technology
- Understanding market trends in food technology
- Analyzing public perception of food-tech products

## Note

The project currently focuses on the software simulation and analytical components. Hardware implementation (like electric stimulation via smart utensils) is outside the scope of this version.
